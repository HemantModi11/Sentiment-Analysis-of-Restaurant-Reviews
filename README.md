# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews

This is a repo where you can find the Machine Learning Algorithm for Sentiment Analysis.
I have used the ML algorithm in restaurant reviews but this can be applied to other things as well.

I have uploaded various Models

1. Naive Bayes and Natural Language Processing
   -- Accuracy = 78.5% with alpha = 0.2
2. Random Forest and TFIDF
